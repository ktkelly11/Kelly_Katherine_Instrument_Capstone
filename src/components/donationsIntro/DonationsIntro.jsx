          We welcome donations of band and orchestra instruments, including
          strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion and guitars. We do not accept
          pianos and organs. Simply fill out our form and we will contact you.

          Almost all instruments need some repair so they are in the best,
          playable condition when schools receive them, so donâ€™t worry if your
          instrument needs adjustment, tuning or minor repairs. Our partners
          repair our donated instruments at a greatly reduced cost.
