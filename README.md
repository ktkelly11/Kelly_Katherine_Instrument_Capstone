# Secondhand Musical Instrument Donation Page

## The Idea

For my Capstone, I wanted to create a project that my family has been talking about for a while now. It involves my dear mom and my brother who is a music teacher at a public school in Vermont. My mom one day found a used trumpet that, with a little bit of repair, would make a lovely instrument for my brother's class to use. He is always trying to raise funds and get instruments into the hands of his students who need them and thus the idea was born, a musical instrument donation site to get no longer used instruments into the hands of students who could benefit from them.

## Tech

I used a number of open source languages and frameworks to make this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React JS
- Express and Node
- Mongoose

This is in a public repository on GitHub.
